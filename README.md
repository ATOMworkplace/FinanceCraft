<h2>Implementation</h2>
<h3>Web Development</h3>
<p>FinanceCraft's web interface is designed with user experience in mind. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we create dynamic web pages that allow users to navigate seamlessly and interact with the platform's features. Express.js and Node.js power the backend, handling server-side logic and API requests.</p>

<h3>Machine Learning</h3>
<p>In the backend, Python and Jupyter Notebook serve as the foundation for implementing machine learning algorithms. Leveraging libraries such as Pandas and Scikit-learn, we preprocess and analyze historical stock market data. The trained models, including Random Forest, SVM, and Linear Regression, enable FinanceCraft to forecast stock market trends accurately.</p>

<h3>Data Integration</h3>
<p>FinanceCraft integrates with Alpha Vantage and Yahoo Finance APIs to fetch real-time and historical stock market data. This data is then processed, cleaned, and transformed into actionable insights using Python's data manipulation capabilities.</p>

<h2>Results and Performance Analysis</h2>
<h3>Random Forest</h3>
<p>The Random Forest model achieves an accuracy score of approximately 50%, indicating performance comparable to random guessing. Further enhancements, such as feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning, are recommended to improve predictive accuracy.</p>

<h3>SVM (Support Vector Machine)</h3>
<p>The SVM classifier provides an interactive interface for users to select stock symbols and date ranges. It fetches historical data from Yahoo Finance API, calculates binary variables, and visualizes decision boundaries. Interactive widgets allow users to explore and analyze stock price trends effectively.</p>
